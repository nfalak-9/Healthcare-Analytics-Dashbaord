Patient Data Analysis Dashboard
   This project demonstrates proficiency in healthcare analytics and business intelligence tools, utilizing Power BI and SQL to analyze patient data. The goal is to improve healthcare operations and patient care by providing insights into key metrics such as patient satisfaction, wait times, and referral trends.

Project Overview
   The Patient Data Analysis Dashboard is designed to help healthcare organizations make data-driven decisions to enhance 
  efficiency and patient care. By visualizing and analyzing patient data, this project aims to provide actionable insights 
  for improving healthcare operations.

Key Metrics and Insights

1) Average Wait Time
•	Discover how long patients typically wait before their appointments.
•	Uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the efficiency of our healthcare system.

3) Patient Satisfaction
•	Explore the average satisfaction scores given by our patients.
•	Learn about the factors that contribute to a positive patient experience and how we can enhance it.

5) Total Patient Visits Monthly
•	Get an overview of the ebb and flow of patients through our doors each month.
•	Understand the dynamics of healthcare demand over time.

7) Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments
•	Delve into the data to distinguish between appointments that involve administrative processes and those that don't.
•	Explore the impact on wait times and patient satisfaction.

9) Referrals and Walk-In Patients
•	Uncover the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who walk in without prior referral.
•	Understand the impact on the overall patient experience.

11) Patient Visits by Age Group and Race
•	Explore the distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races.
•	Gain insights into the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences.

Analysis and Results

•	Average Wait Time Analysis: By analyzing the average wait times, we can identify bottlenecks in the patient flow and work on strategies to reduce wait times, thereby improving patient satisfaction.
•	Patient Satisfaction Scores: Analyzing satisfaction scores helps us understand the key drivers of patient satisfaction and areas where we can make improvements.
•	Monthly Patient Visits: Understanding the monthly trends in patient visits allows for better resource allocation and planning.
•	Administrative Processes: Distinguishing between administrative and non-administrative appointments helps us understand how administrative tasks impact overall efficiency and patient satisfaction.
•	Referrals vs. Walk-Ins: Analyzing the balance between referrals and walk-in patients helps us optimize the referral process and manage walk-in patient flow effectively.
•	Demographic Insights: Exploring patient visits by age group and race provides valuable insights into the diverse needs and preferences of our patient population, enabling us to tailor our services accordingly.

Conclusion
   The Patient Data Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into various aspects of healthcare operations and patient care. By leveraging these insights, healthcare organizations can make informed decisions to improve efficiency, enhance patient satisfaction, and deliver better healthcare services.
